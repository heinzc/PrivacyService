# Building and installing HElib

HElib's build and install has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, 
CentOS 7.6, and macOS High Sierra 10.13.

## Dependencies

- cmake >= 3.5.1
- GNU make
- g++ >= 5.4.0 or clang >= 3.8
- pthreads

## Option 1: package build (recommended for most users)

This option bundles HElib and its dependencies (NTL and GMP) in one directory
which can then be moved around freely on the system.  NTL and GMP will be
automatically fetched and compiled.  It can be installed globally (i.e. under
`/usr/local`), which is the default option if no `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` is
specified, but this should only be done with caution as existing versions of
NTL, GMP, or HElib will be overwritten.  Two more dependencies will be required
in this case:

- patchelf (if building on Linux)
- m4

Please note that if changing from library build to package build, it is safer 
to use a clean build directory.

### Instructions

1. Create a build directory, typically as a sibling of `src`:
```
cd HElib
mkdir build
cd build
```

2. Run the cmake configuration step, specifying that you want a package build
(via -DPACKAGE_BUILD=ON) and saying where you would like the installation to
be. To install in `/home/alice/helib_install`, for example:
```
cmake -DPACKAGE_BUILD=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/alice/helib_install ..
```

Extra options can be specified here, such as enabling tests with 
`-DENABLE_TEST=ON`.  See later section entitled "HElib build
options" for details.

3. Compile, with an optional number of threads specified (16 in this example).
The output of this will be in the relocatable folder `helib_pack`:
```
make -j16
```

4. (optional) If step 2 was performed with `-DENABLE_TEST=ON`, tests can be run
as follows:
```
make test
```
This will run the tests for GMP, NTL, and HElib.  More detailed logging can be
found in `Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log`.
An even more detailed HElib-specific test logs can be found in 
`dependencies/Build/helib_external/Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log`.

5. (optional) Run the install step, to copy the folder `helib_pack` to
`${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}` (in this example `/home/alice/helib_install`):
```
make install
```

of course, if the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` was kept as the default `/usr/local`
or some other system-wide path, step 5 needs to be run as root.


## Option 2: library build (advanced)

This option involves building HElib on its own, linking against pre-existing
dependencies (NTL and GMP) on the system.  In this way, the HElib library can
be moved around, but its dependencies (NTL and GMP) cannot, as they are
absolute paths.  For this option, you must build GMP >=6.0.0 and NTL >=11.0.0
yourself.  For details on how to do this, please see the section on building
dependencies later.  We will suppose throughout this that the environment
variables `$GMPDIR` and `$NTLDIR` are set to point to the installation
directories of GMP and NTL respectively.

Please note that if changing from package build to library build, it is safer 
to use a clean build directory.

1. Create a build directory, typically as a sibling of `src`:


```
cd HElib
mkdir build
cd build
```

2. Run the cmake configuration step, specifying where to find NTL and GMP.  If
not specified, system-wide locations such as `/usr/local/lib` will be searched.
 To install in `/home/alice/helib_install`, for example:

```
cmake -DGMP_DIR="${GMPDIR}" -DNTL_DIR="${NTLDIR}" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/alice/helib_install ..
```

Extra options can be specified here, such as enabling tests with 
`-DENABLE_TEST=ON`.  See later section entitled "HElib build options" for
details.

3. Compile, with an optional number of threads specified (16 in this example):

```
make -j16
```

4. (optional) If step 2 was performed with `-DENABLE_TEST=ON`, tests can be run
as follows:
```
make test
```
The complete test output can be found in
`Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log`.

5. Run the install step, to copy the files to `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}` (in
this example `/home/alice/helib_install`):
```
make install
```

of course, if the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` was kept as the default `/usr/local`
or some other system-wide path, step 5 needs to be run as root.

## Building dependencies (for option 2)

### GMP

Many distributions come with GMP pre-installed.
If not, you can install GMP as follows.

1. Download GMP from http://www.gmplib.org -- make sure that you get GMP
   >=6.0.0 (current version is 6.1.2).
2. Decompress and cd into the gmp directory (e.g., `gmp-6.1.2`).
3. GMP is compiled in the standard unix way:
```
      ./configure
      make
      sudo make install
```

This will install GMP into `/usr/local` by default.


**NOTE:** For further options when building GMP, run `./configure --help` in
step 3.

### NTL

You can install NTL as follows:

1. Download NTL >=11.0.0 (current version is 11.3.0) from
   http://www.shoup.net/ntl/download.html
2. Decompress and cd into the directory, e.g., `ntl-11.3.0/src`
3. NTL is configured, built and installed in the standard Unix way (but
remember to specify the following flags to `configure`):
```
      ./configure NTL_GMP_LIP=ON SHARED=on
      make
      sudo make install
```
This should install NTL into `/usr/local`.

**NOTE:** For further options when building NTL, run `./configure --help` in
step 3.

**NOTE**: if linking against a non-system GMP, pass `GMP_PREFIX=<path/to/gmp>`
to the `./configure` step.

## HElib build options

### Generic options
- `BUILD_SHARED=ON/OFF` (default is ON): Build as shared library.
  Note that buildinh HElib (regardless of BUILD_SHARED) will fail if NTL
  is not built as a shared library. The default for NTL is static library,
  to build NTL as a shared library use `./configure SHARED=on` in step 1. 
- `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`: Choose the type of build, options are: Debug,
RelWithDebInfo, Release, MinSizeRel.
- `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`: Desired installation directory for HElib.
- `ENABLE_TEST=ON/OFF` (default is OFF): Enable building of tests. This will
  include an automatic download step for the google test framework.
- `ENABLE_THREADS=ON/OFF` (default is ON): Enable threading support. This must
  be on if and only if NTL was built with `NTL_THREADS=ON`.
- `PEDANTIC_BUILD=ON/OFF` (default is OFF): Use `-Wall -Wpedantic -Wextra -Werror`
  during build. HElib currently will not build with these flags.

### Parameters specific to option 1 (package build)
- `PACKAGE_DIR`: Location that a package build will be installed to.  Defaults
to `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/helib_pack`.
- `FETCH_GMP`: Whether or not to fetch and build GMP.  Defaults to `ON`.  If 
set to `OFF`, there should either exist a system-installed GMP library, or 
`GMP_DIR` should point to a valid GMP prefix.
- `GMP_DIR`: Prefix of the GMP library.  Ignored if `FETCH_GMP=ON`.

### Parameters specific to option 2 (library build)
- `ENABLE_LEGACY_TEST=ON/OFF` (default is OFF): Build old test system (deprecated).
- `BUILD_AES=ON/OFF` (default is OFF): Build homomorphic AES.
- `GMP_DIR`: Prefix of the GMP library.
- `NTL_DIR`: Prefix of the NTL library.

# Using HElib in a project

## Standard method

After `make install` has been run in either option 1 or option 2, one can find
the required shared library files to link against in `lib` and the header files
in `include`.  These can be used in the preferred way with your build system of
choice.

## Package build with cmake

Another, easier way is possible if you are using HElib in a cmake project.

1. Include the following line in your `CMakeLists.txt`:
```
find_package(helib)
```
2. Run your `cmake` step with `-Dhelib_DIR=<helib install prefix>/share/cmake/helib`.

## Example

A full working example of a cmake-based project which uses HElib can be found 
in the `example_program` directory.
